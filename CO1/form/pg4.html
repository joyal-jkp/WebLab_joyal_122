            <li>Advanced software engineering</li> 
<dd><p>-Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality.</p></dd>
    
            <li>Advanced datastructure</li>
<dd><p>-A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.</p></dd>
            <li>Advanced digital fundamentals</li>
<dd><p>-Digital electronics are those electronics systems that use a digital signal instead of an analog signal. Digital electronics are the most common representation of Boolean algebra and are the basis of all digital circuits for computers, mobile phones, and numerous other consumer products.</p></dd>
            <li>Mathematical foundation and computing</li>
<dd><p>-Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science explains the fundamental concepts in mathematics. It can be used by the students in computer science as an introduction to the underlying ideas of mathematics for computer science.</p></dd>
